// PodSetAssignmentApplyConfiguration represents a declarative configuration of the PodSetAssignment type for use

type PodSetAssignmentApplyConfiguration struct {
	// name is the name of the podSet. It should match one of the names in .spec.podSets.
	Name *kueuev1beta1.PodSetReference `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// flavors are the flavors assigned to the workload for each resource.
	Flavors map[v1.ResourceName]kueuev1beta1.ResourceFlavorReference `json:"flavors,omitempty"`
	// resourceUsage keeps track of the total resources all the pods in the podset need to run.
	//
	// Beside what is provided in podSet's specs, this calculation takes into account
	// the LimitRange defaults and RuntimeClass overheads at the moment of admission.
	// This field will not change in case of quota reclaim.
	ResourceUsage *v1.ResourceList `json:"resourceUsage,omitempty"`
	// count is the number of pods taken into account at admission time.
	// This field will not change in case of quota reclaim.
	// Value could be missing for Workloads created before this field was added,

	Count *int32 `json:"count,omitempty"`
	// topologyAssignment indicates the topology assignment divided into
	// topology domains corresponding to the lowest level of the topology.
	// The assignment specifies the number of Pods to be scheduled per topology
	// domain and specifies the node selectors for each topology domain, in the
	// following way: the node selector keys are specified by the levels field
	// (same for all domains), and the corresponding node selector value is
	// specified by the domains.values subfield. If the TopologySpec.Levels field contains
	// "kubernetes.io/hostname" label, topologyAssignment will contain data only for
	// this label, and omit higher levels in the topology
	//
	// Example:
	//
	// topologyAssignment:
	// levels:
	// - cloud.provider.com/topology-block
	// - cloud.provider.com/topology-rack
	// domains:
	// - values: [block-1, rack-1]
	// count: 4
	// - values: [block-1, rack-2]
	// count: 2
	//
	// Here:
	// - 4 Pods are to be scheduled on nodes matching the node selector:
	// cloud.provider.com/topology-block: block-1
	// cloud.provider.com/topology-rack: rack-1
	// - 2 Pods are to be scheduled on nodes matching the node selector:
	// cloud.provider.com/topology-block: block-1
	// cloud.provider.com/topology-rack: rack-2
	//
	// Example:
	// Below there is an equivalent of the above example assuming, Topology
	// object defines kubernetes.io/hostname as the lowest level in topology.
	// Hence we omit higher level of topologies, since the hostname label
	// is sufficient to explicitly identify a proper node.
	//
	// topologyAssignment:
	// levels:
	// - kubernetes.io/hostname
	// domains:
	// - values: [hostname-1]
	// count: 4
	// - values: [hostname-2]
	// count: 2

	// topologyAssignment.

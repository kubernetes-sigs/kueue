// Fair Sharing is compatible with Hierarchical Cohorts (any Cohort
// which has a parent) as of v0.11. Using these features together in

	// ClusterQueues and Cohorts with the lowest share and
	// preempting workloads from the ClusterQueues and Cohorts
	// with the highest share.  A zero weight implies infinite
	// share value, meaning that this Node will always be at
	// disadvantage against other ClusterQueues and Cohorts.

                  A CQ can be a member of a single borrowing cohort. A workload submitted
                  to a queue referencing this CQ can borrow quota from any CQ in the cohort.

                  borrowed.

                  A cohort is a name that links CQs together, but it doesn't reference any
                  object.


                  Validation of a cohort name is equivalent to that of object names:

                  preemption describes policies to preempt Workloads from this ClusterQueue
                  or the ClusterQueue's cohort.


                  Preemption can happen in two scenarios:


                  - When a Workload fits within the nominal quota of the ClusterQueue, but
                    the quota is currently borrowed by other ClusterQueues in the cohort.
                    Preempting Workloads in other ClusterQueues allows this ClusterQueue to
                    reclaim its nominal quota.
                  - When a Workload doesn't fit within the nominal quota of the ClusterQueue
                    and there are admitted Workloads in the ClusterQueue with lower priority.


                  The preemption algorithm tries to find a minimal set of Workloads to
                  preempt to accomomdate the pending Workload, preempting Workloads with
                  lower priority first.

                          priority less than or equal to the specified threshold priority.
                          When the threshold is not specified, then any workload satisfying the
                          policy can be preempted by the borrowing workload.

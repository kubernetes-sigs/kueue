                  ResourceGroups describes groupings of Resources and
                  Flavors.  Each ResourceGroup defines a list of Resources
                  and a list of Flavors which provide quotas for these
                  Resources. Each Resource and each Flavor may only form part
                  of one ResourceGroup.  There may be up to 16 ResourceGroups
                  within a Cohort.

                  BorrowingLimit limits how much members of this Cohort
                  subtree can borrow from the parent subtree.

                  LendingLimit limits how much members of this Cohort subtree
                  can lend to the parent subtree.

                  Borrowing and Lending limits must only be set when the
                  Cohort has a parent.  Otherwise, the Cohort create/update
                  will be rejected by the webhook.

                  nodeLabels are labels that associate the ResourceFlavor with Nodes that
                  have the same labels.
                  When a Workload is admitted, its podsets can only get assigned
                  ResourceFlavors whose nodeLabels match the nodeSelector and nodeAffinity
                  fields.
                  Once a ResourceFlavor is assigned to a podSet, the ResourceFlavor's
                  nodeLabels should be injected into the pods of the Workload by the
                  controller that integrates with the Workload object.


                  nodeLabels can be up to 8 elements.

                  nodeTaints are taints that the nodes associated with this ResourceFlavor
                  have.
                  Workloads' podsets must have tolerations for these nodeTaints in order to
                  get assigned this ResourceFlavor during admission.

                  tolerations are extra tolerations that will be added to the pods admitted in
                  the quota associated with this resource flavor.


                  An example of a toleration is
                  cloud.provider.com/preemptible="true":NoSchedule


                  tolerations can be up to 8 elements.

                    The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches
                    the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.
                  properties:
                    effect:
                      description: |-
                        Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                        When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                      description: |-
                        Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                        If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                    operator:
                      description: |-
                        Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                        Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                        TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                        of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                        Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
                        If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

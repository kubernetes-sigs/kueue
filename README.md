# Kueue

Kueue is a set of APIs and controller for [job](docs/concepts/workload.md)
[queueing](docs/concepts#queueing). It is a job-level manager that decides when
a job should be [admitted](docs/concepts#admission) to start (as in pods can be
created) and when it should stop (as in active pods should be deleted).

## Why use Kueue

Kueue is a lean controller that you can install on top of a vanilla Kubernetes
cluster without replacing any components. It is compatible with cloud
environments where:
- Nodes and other compute resources can be scaled up and down.
- Compute resources are heterogeneous (in architecture, availability, price, etc.).

Kueue APIs allow you to express:
- Quotas and policies for fair sharing among tenants.
- Resource fungibility: if a [resource flavor](docs/concepts/cluster_queue.md#resourceflavor-object)
  is fully utilized, run the [job](docs/concepts/workload.md) using a different
  flavor.

The main design principle for Kueue is to avoid duplicating mature functionality
in [Kubernetes components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/)
and well-established third-party controllers. Autoscaling, pod-to-node scheduling and
job lifecycle management are the responsibility of cluster-autoscaler,
kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager, respectively. Advanced
admission control can be delegated to controllers such as [gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper).

## Installation

**Requires Kubernetes 1.22 or newer**.

To install the latest release of Kueue in your cluster, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/releases/download/v0.1.1/manifests.yaml
```

The controller runs in the `kueue-system` namespace.

Read the [installation guide](/docs/setup/install.md) to learn more.

## Usage

A minimal configuration can be set by running the [samples](config/samples):

```
kubectl apply -f config/samples/single-clusterqueue-setup.yaml
```

Then you can run a job with:

```
kubectl create -f config/samples/sample-job.yaml
```

// FailurePolicyRule defines a FailurePolicyAction to be executed if a child job
// fails due to a reason listed in OnJobFailureReasons and a message pattern
// listed in OnJobFailureMessagePatterns. The rule must match both the job
// failure reason and the job failure message. The rules are evaluated in
// order and the first matching rule is executed.

## Summary

[Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/)
is a major effort to improve device support in Kubernetes. It changes how one can request resources in a myriad of ways.

## Motivation

Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) provides the groundwork for more sophisticated device allocations to Pods.
Quota management is about enforcing rules around the use of resources.
For example, GPUs are resource constrained and a popular request is the ability to enforce fair sharing of GPU
resources.
With these devices, many users want access and sometimes some users want the ability to preempt other users if their
workloads have a higher priority. Kueue provides support for this.

DRA provides a future where users could schedule partitionable GPU devices (MIG) or time slicing. As devices gain a
more robust way to schedule, it is important to walk through how support of DRA will work with Kueue.

### Background

DRA has four APIs that are relevant for a Kueue:

- ResourceClaims
- ResourceClaimTemplates
- DeviceClasses
- ResourceSlices

#### DRA Example

The easiest way to test DRA is to
use [dra example driver repository](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dra-example-driver). Cloning that repo and
running
`make setup-e2e` will create a Kind cluster with the DRA feature gate and install a mock dra driver. This does not use
actual GPUs so it is perfect for a test environment for exploring Kueue and DRA integration.

#### Workload Example

An example workload that uses DRA:

```yaml
---

apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1alpha3
kind: ResourceClaimTemplate
metadata:
  namespace: gpu-test1
  name: single-gpu
spec:
  spec:
    devices:
      requests:
      - name: gpu
        deviceClassName: gpu.example.com
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  namespace: gpu-test1
  name: job0
  labels:
    app: job
    kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name: user-queue
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
      - name: ctr0
        image: ubuntu:22.04
        command: ["bash", "-c"]
        args: ["export; sleep 9999"]
        resources:
          claims:
          - name: gpu
          requests:
            cpu: 1
            memory: "200Mi"
      resourceClaims:
      - name: gpu
        resourceClaimTemplateName: single-gpu
```

#### Example Driver Cluster Resources

The dra-example-driver creates a ResourceSlice for each node and a DeviceClass named `gpu.example.com` for the entire
cluster.

##### ResourceSlices

ResourceSlices are meant for communication between drivers and the control planes. These are not expected to be used for
workloads.

##### DeviceClasses

Each driver creates a device class and every resource claim will reference the device class. The dra-example-driver has
a simple device class named `gpu.example.com`. This will be the way to enforce quota limits.

### Goals

- Users can submit workloads using resource claims and Kueue can monitor the usage.
- Admins can enforce the quota for number of devices for a given DeviceClass.


### Non-Goals

- We are limiting scope for DRA to structured parameters (beta in 1.32 and 1.33)
    - Support for alpha features like DRADeviceTaints, DRAAdminAccess, DRAPrioritizedLists and DRAPartitionableDevices
      will not be included.
- This design does not work with Topology Aware Scheduling feature of Kueue. It is a significant amount of work, will be
  addressed in the future with a separate body of work

## Proposal

This proposal extends Kueue to support workloads using DRA APIs for quota management, borrowing and preemptable
scheduling. This includes:

1. Extending the existing Kueue Configuration API with `DeviceClassMappings` to map device classes to logical resource
   names
2. Supporting workloads that use ResourceClaimTemplates (ResourceClaims are not supported in alpha)
3. Allowing admins to define quota for DRA resources in ClusterQueues using the logical resource names from device class
   mappings
4. Implementing validation to prevent device class conflicts and ensure predictable quota behavior

More details are documented in [Design Details](#design-details)

### User Stories (Optional)

#### Story 1

As a Kueue user, I want to use DRA devices for batch workloads in Kubernetes using Kueue

#### Story 2

As an administrator of Kueue with ClusterQueue, I have a DRA driver installed in the cluster. I would like to enforce
queuing, quota management and preemptable workloads for cluster users.

#### Story 3

As a cluster administrator, I want clear validation feedback when I misconfigure device class mappings so I can quickly
identify and fix configuration conflicts before they affect workload scheduling.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

- The `ResourceClaims` and `ResourceClaimTemplates` APIs for DRA in k8s are immutable.
- ResourceClaims are not supported in alpha - workloads must use ResourceClaimTemplates.
  Direct ResourceClaim references will result in inadmissible workloads.
- Device class uniqueness is enforced - each device class can only map to one resource name to prevent quota ambiguity.
- Configuration-based approach - device class mappings are configured through the Kueue Configuration API
- This design does not work with Kueue's Topology Aware Scheduling feature and will be addressed in future work.
- This implementation focuses on structured parameters (GA in 1.34) and does not support alpha DRA features
  like DRADeviceTaints, DRAAdminAccess, DRAPrioritizedLists, and DRAPartitionableDevices.

### Risks and Mitigations

With newer DRA features like DRAAdminAccess and DRAPrioritizedLists, there is a risk that
effective tallying of resources will not be available until after allocation of these resources by kube-scheduler.

In order to mitigate this risk, Kueue can take the following approach:
1. For DRAPrioritizedLists: all the mentioned device classes in the request will be counted against the quota
2. For DRAAdminAccess: This feature can only be enabled in admin namespace, therefore it should be skipped for being
   counted against ClusterQuota. This is a different stance than Kubernetes ResourceQuota because kubernetes
   ResourceQuota is namespace scoped. As a result, admin users can account for quota independent of user workloads.
   On the contrary, with Kueue, since quota is part of ClusterQuota a cluster scoped object, admin workloads using
   devices in admin namespace if counted against quota, will eat up quota meant for user workloads.
3. For ResourceClaims with allocation mode `All`: worst-case scenario of the max number of devices that could be
   allocated to a single claim will be used against quota.


## Design Details

A new feature gate DynamicResourceAllocation will be introduced, allowing users to test it in dev environments while
making the changes dormant for production users. The following sections will explain the design in detail.

### Configuration API Extension for DRA

DRA device class mappings are configured through the existing Kueue Configuration API rather than a standalone CRD.
This approach provides a centralized configuration mechanism and avoids the complexity of managing additional CRDs.

```golang
// Resources struct in the Configuration API
type Resources struct {
    // DeviceClassMappings defines mappings from device classes to logical resources
    // for Dynamic Resource Allocation support.
    // +optional
    DeviceClassMappings []DeviceClassMapping `json:"deviceClassMappings,omitempty"`
}

// DeviceClassMapping holds device class to logical resource mappings
// for Dynamic Resource Allocation support.
type DeviceClassMapping struct {
    // Name is referenced in ClusterQueue.nominalQuota and Workload status.
    // Must be a valid fully qualified name consisting of an optional DNS subdomain prefix
    // followed by a slash and a DNS label, or just a DNS label.
    // DNS labels consist of lower-case alphanumeric characters or hyphens,
    // and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
    // DNS subdomain prefixes follow the same rules as DNS labels but can contain periods.
    // The total length must not exceed 253 characters.
    Name corev1.ResourceName `json:"name"`

    // DeviceClassNames enumerates the DeviceClasses represented by this resource name.
    // Each device class name must be a valid qualified name consisting of an optional DNS subdomain prefix
    // followed by a slash and a DNS label, or just a DNS label.
    // DNS labels consist of lower-case alphanumeric characters or hyphens,
    // and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
    // DNS subdomain prefixes follow the same rules as DNS labels but can contain periods.
    // The total length of each name must not exceed 253 characters.
    DeviceClassNames []corev1.ResourceName `json:"deviceClassNames"`
}
```

The cluster admin defines the mappings from device classes to logical resource names, which can then be used to
define quotas in ClusterQueues.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kueue-controller-manager-config
  namespace: kueue-system
data:
  config.yaml: |
    apiVersion: config.kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Configuration
    namespace: kueue-system
    manageJobsWithoutQueueName: false
    resources:
      deviceClassMappings:
      - name: whole-gpus
        deviceClassNames:
        - gpu.example.com
      - name: shared-gpus
        deviceClassNames:
        - ts-shard-gpus.example.com
        - sp-shared-gpus.example.com
---
apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ResourceFlavor
metadata:
  name: "default-gpu-flavor"
spec:
  # No changed needed here
---
apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterQueue
metadata:
  name: "gpus-cluster-queue"
spec:
  resourceGroups:
  - coveredResources: ["cpu", "memory", "whole-gpus", "shared-gpus"]
    flavors:
    - name: "default-gpu-flavor"
      resources:
      - name: "cpu"
        nominalQuota: 9
      - name: "memory"
        nominalQuota: "1200Mi"
      - name: 'whole-gpus'
        nominalQuota: 2
      - name: 'shared-gpus'
        nominalQuota: 2
```

The above ClusterQueue is an example configuration of a queue, with half quota configured for single allocation of
example
GPUs, and half quota configured for GPUs that are shared by workloads. Similarly, when DRAPartitionableDevices feature
is supported in kubernetes, GPUs partitions can be represented by a single device class.

### Device Class Resolution and Conflict Prevention

#### Device Class Mapping Uniqueness

To ensure predictable and deterministic quota enforcement, Kueue enforces strict uniqueness constraints on device class
mappings. Each device class can only map to one resource name across all device class mappings in the configuration.

Kueue prevents ambiguous configurations through validation at configuration load time. The following configuration
would be rejected:

```yaml
# INVALID - This configuration will be rejected during validation
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kueue-controller-manager-config
  namespace: kueue-system
data:
  config.yaml: |
    apiVersion: config.kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Configuration
    resources:
      deviceClassMappings:
      - name: whole-gpus
        deviceClassNames:
        - gpus.example.com          # Appears here
      - name: fast-gpus
        deviceClassNames:
        - gpus.example.com          # ERROR: Duplicate device class name
``

Example of valid configuration:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kueue-controller-manager-config
  namespace: kueue-system
data:
  config.yaml: |
    apiVersion: config.kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Configuration
    resources:
      deviceClassMappings:
      - name: whole-gpus
        deviceClassNames:
        - whole-gpus.example.com     # Unique device class
      - name: fast-gpus
        deviceClassNames:
        - fast-gpus.example.com      # Different device class
```

This validation approach eliminates ambiguity at configuration time rather than requiring complex runtime resolution logic, ensuring predictable and efficient workload admission.

### RBAC Requirements

DRA support requires additional RBAC permissions for the Kueue controller to access DRA resources:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: kueue-controller-role
rules:
# ... existing permissions ...

# DRA-specific permissions
- apiGroups: ["resource.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["resourceclaims"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: ["resource.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["resourceclaimtemplates"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

**Required Permissions:**
- `resourceclaims`: Read access to validate ResourceClaim references (though not supported for quota)
- `resourceclaimtemplates`: Read access to process ResourceClaimTemplates and extract device class information

**Security Considerations:**
- Kueue only requires read permissions - no create, update, or delete access to DRA resources
- Permissions are cluster-scoped to allow processing workloads across all namespaces
- No elevated privileges required beyond standard Kueue controller permissions

### Workloads

#### DRA-Specific Workload Processing

DRA workloads require special handling to ensure proper resource validation and quota enforcement. Unlike standard
workloads that are processed immediately in event handlers, DRA workloads are processed in the controller's Reconcile
loop to enable proper error handling and retry logic.


1. Event Handler Behavior: When a DRA workload is created or updated, the event handlers detect the presence of
   ResourceClaimTemplates or ResourceClaims and if feature gate is enabled, skip normal queue operations, deferring
   processing to the Reconcile loop.
2. Reconcile Loop Processing: The Reconcile method handles all DRA-specific logic including:
   - Feature gate validation
   - ResourceClaim vs ResourceClaimTemplate support validation
   - Device class mapping resolution
   - Resource preprocessing and queue admission
3. Error Handling: DRA processing errors are properly handled with exponential backoff retry logic.

#### Workload Processing Flow

When a user submits a workload and DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate is enabled, Kueue processes it as follows:
1. DRA Detection: Kueue detects DRA workloads by checking for ResourceClaimTemplates or ResourceClaims in
   podSpec.resourceClaims.
2. Feature Gate Validation: Verify that the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate is enabled. If disabled, continue
   with legacy behavior.
3. ResourceClaim Support Validation: Check if the workload uses ResourceClaims (not supported in alpha) or
   ResourceClaimTemplates (supported):
   - ResourceClaims: Mark workload as inadmissible with an error message
   - ResourceClaimTemplates: Continue processing
4. Device Class Resolution: For each ResourceClaimTemplate:
   - Read the ResourceClaimTemplate from the same namespace as the workload
   - Extract deviceClassName from each request in the template spec
   - Look up the corresponding resource name using the device class mappings from the Configuration API
5. Resource Preprocessing:
   - Calculate total device count per device class across all containers and init containers
   - Map device classes to resource names using the configuration
   - Generate preprocessed resource requests for queue admission
6. Queue Admission: Add the workload to the queue with preprocessed DRA resources.
7. Status Update: Once admitted, the workload status reflects the assigned flavors and resource usage including DRA resources.

The steps above are reflected in the complete configuration and workload example below:

```yaml
# Step 1: Configure device class mappings in Kueue Configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kueue-controller-manager-config
  namespace: kueue-system
data:
  config.yaml: |
    apiVersion: config.kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Configuration
    namespace: kueue-system
    resources:
      deviceClassMappings:
      - name: whole-gpus
        deviceClassNames:
        - gpu.example.com # Maps gpu.example.com -> whole-gpus
---
# Step 2: Define ClusterQueue with DRA resource quotas
apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterQueue
metadata:
  name: "gpus-cluster-queue"
spec:
  resourceGroups:
  - coveredResources: ["cpu", "memory", "whole-gpus"]
    flavors:
    - name: "default-gpu-flavor"
      resources:
      - name: "cpu"
        nominalQuota: 9
      - name: "memory"
        nominalQuota: "1200Mi"
      - name: 'whole-gpus' # References the resource name from Configuration
        nominalQuota: 2
---
# Step 3: Create ResourceClaimTemplate (only templates are supported)
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1alpha3
kind: ResourceClaimTemplate
metadata:
  namespace: gpu-test1
  name: single-gpu
spec:
  spec:
    devices:
      requests:
      - name: gpu
        deviceClassName: gpu.example.com # Device class from the mapping
---
# Step 4: Submit workload using ResourceClaimTemplate
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  namespace: gpu-test1
  name: job0
  labels:
    app: job
    kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name: user-queue
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
      - name: ctr0
        image: ubuntu:22.04
        command: ["bash", "-c"]
        args: ["export; sleep 9999"]
        resources:
          claims:
          - name: gpu # Reference to the resource claim
          requests:
            cpu: 1
            memory: "200Mi"
      resourceClaims:
      - name: gpu
        resourceClaimTemplateName: single-gpu # Must use template, not direct claim
---
# Step 5: Resulting Workload status after admission
apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Workload
metadata:
  name: job-job0-6f46e
  namespace: gpu-test1
# ... spec omitted for brevity ...
status:
  admission:
    clusterQueue: gpus-cluster-queue
    podSetAssignments:
    - count: 1
      flavors:
        cpu: default-gpu-flavor
        memory: default-gpu-flavor
        whole-gpus: default-gpu-flavor # DRA resource assigned to flavor
      name: main
      resourceUsage:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: "200Mi"
        whole-gpus: "1" # DRA device count reflected in status
```

### Architecture Details

#### Queue Manager Extensions

The queue manager has been extended to support DRA resource preprocessing through the InfoOption pattern:

```golang
// Extended method signatures
func (m *Manager) AddOrUpdateWorkload(wl *kueue.Workload, opts ...workload.InfoOption) error
func (m *Manager) UpdateWorkload(oldWl, newWl *kueue.Workload, opts ...workload.InfoOption) error

// DRA-specific InfoOption
func WithPreprocessedDRAResources(resources map[kueue.PodSetReference]corev1.ResourceList) workload.InfoOption
```

Processing Flow:
1. DRA Preprocessing: Controller processes ResourceClaimTemplates and calculates resource requirements
2. InfoOption Creation: Preprocessed resources are wrapped in `WithPreprocessedDRAResources` option
3. Queue Integration: Queue manager receives workload with preprocessed DRA data
4. Scheduler Access: Scheduler gets workload with DRA resources already calculated and validated

This architecture separates concerns between DRA processing (controller) and queue management (scheduler), enabling robust error handling and retry logic for DRA-specific operations.

### Test Plan

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

<!--
Based on reviewers feedback describe what additional tests need to be added prior
implementing this enhancement to ensure the enhancements have also solid foundations.
-->

#### Unit Tests

<!--
In principle every added code should have complete unit test coverage, so providing
the exact set of tests will not bring additional value.
However, if complete unit test coverage is not possible, explain the reason of it
together with explanation why this is acceptable.
-->

<!--
Additionally, try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>

This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.

#### Integration tests

Integration tests in Kueue use controller-runtime's envtest framework, which provides a real Kubernetes API server
without requiring kubelet or other cluster components. While DRA device allocation requires kubelet plugins, the core
DRA integration functionality for Kueue can be tested at the integration level by:

- Testing Configuration API validation for device class mappings
- Verifying workload admission logic with DRA ResourceClaimTemplates
- Testing quota enforcement against device class mappings
- Validating resource counting and flavor assignment for DRA resources
- Testing error scenarios (feature gate disabled, unsupported ResourceClaims, unmapped device classes)
- Verifying DRA workload processing in Reconcile loop vs event handlers

The integration tests focus on Kueue's quota management and admission logic rather than actual device allocation,
using mock ResourceClaimTemplates and DeviceClasses to simulate DRA workloads. Key test scenarios include:

- Configuration validation: Testing device class conflict detection
- Workload inadmissibility: Testing various error conditions and proper WorkloadInadmissible condition setting
- Resource preprocessing: Verifying correct device count calculation from ResourceClaimTemplates
- Queue integration: Testing workload admission with preprocessed DRA resources

#### E2E Test

Use existing dra-example-driver or Kubernetes test driver for e2e testing.

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha

- the implementation behind the feature gate flag in alpha
- support Beta API of the core k8s
- initial e2e tests for baseline scenario

#### Beta

- the feature gate in Beta
- all known bugs are fixed
- support integration with v1 API of DRA in core k8s
- support integration with MultiKueue
- e2e tests
- re-evaluate the support for TopologyAwareScheduling (might be moved to GA)

#### GA

- the feature gate in stable
- integration with TopologyAwareScheduling

## Implementation History

- Initial draft on September 16th 2024 by @kannon92
- Implementation development: September-December 2024
- Design evolution from standalone CRD to Configuration API approach: October 2024
- Alpha implementation completed: December 2024
- KEP updated to reflect actual implementation: September 2025 by @alaypatel07

**Key Design Evolution:**
- **Original Design**: Standalone DynamicResourceAllocationConfig CRD with runtime ambiguity resolution
- **Final Implementation**: Configuration API extension with strict validation and conflict prevention
- **Architecture Decision**: DRA processing moved to Reconcile loop for proper error handling
- **Scope Refinement**: ResourceClaims support removed, focus on ResourceClaimTemplates only

## Drawbacks

**Configuration Restart Requirement**: Changes to device class mappings require controller restart, which may cause brief service interruption. This is acceptable for alpha feature but should be addressed in future versions.

**ResourceClaims Not Supported**: Users with existing ResourceClaim-based workloads cannot use Kueue quota management and must migrate to ResourceClaimTemplates.

**Limited Dynamic Reconfiguration**: Unlike some other Kueue features, DRA configuration cannot be changed dynamically and requires controller restart.

## Alternatives

### ResourceClaim By Count

Keeping a tally of the resource claims for a given workload could be another mechanism for enforcing quota.
However, the issue with this is that resource claims are namespaced scoped, to enforce quota usage across namespaces
kueue need to rely on a cluster-scope resource.

Additionally, ResourceClaims capture the intent of the user on what kind of device is request. The request could mean
anything from one small allocatable device to several devices or entire resource pool. Therefore, tracking the number
of requests becomes non-intuitive. The need is to count devices going to be allocated to those requests.

### Using devices in ResourceSlice to Count

DRA drivers publish resources for each node, which could be used as a mechanism for counting resources. However, in DRA
implementation, ResourceSlices are used for driver/scheduler communication. The only way users can request dynamic
resources is via ResourceClaims. ResourceClaims does not have the notion of what devices will be allocated a priori.

Enforcing quota requires two inputs, 1) user request and 2) system usages. With using ResourceSlice, the first
requirement
is missing.

### Using a CEL expression

Cluster admin might have to create new deviceclass for narrowing set of target devices in existing device class for
setting quota. Moreover, when existing users use the old device classes, they might have to migrate to the new
deviceclass.
For example, assume gpu.example.com deviceclass exists, and each device has device attribute "memory" there are existing
users who have resourceclaims with the deviceclass and selector like this:
```yaml
kind: ResourceClaim
name: one-large-gpu
spec:
requests:
- name: gpu-large
  deviceClassName: gpu.example.com
  selectors:
    - cel:
      expression: device.attributes["memory"] >= 80g
```

Now, if Kueue admin wants to set quota for gpu.example.com devices with device.attribute["memory"]>=80g, Kueue admin
might have to create a device class and use the new device class in clusterqueue:

```yaml
kind: DeviceClass
name: large-gpu.example.com
spec:
  selectors:
  - cel:
      expression: device.driver == "gpu.example.com" && device.attributes["memory"] >= 80g
```

Then, existing users might have to migrate/switch their ResourceClaim with large-gpu.example.com device class from
existing one.

For minimizing user impact, there could be an API change that allows CEL expression along with deviceclass name in
defining the Kueue quota, like this:
```yaml
kind: Device
nominalQuota: 2
devices:
  # We might be able to extend this object to support
  # partitionable devices, etc. in the future??
- className: gpu.example.com
  selectors:
  - cel:
      expression: device.attributes["memory"] >= 80g
```

This indeed improves the user experience, but with a cel expression like that, whether a device having attributes that
evaluates the cel expression to true or not, will only be available after the scheduler allocates the device for the
claim. Kueue needs to know the device and count it before admitting the workload and hence before it hits the
kube-scheduler. Any inclusion relationship between two boolean formulae in ResourceClaim and ClusterQueue cannot be
assumed.

For example, assume the following ResourceClaim and ClusterQueue exist. In this situation, it is clear that there could
be both cases where the allocation result consumes and does not consume the quota (i.e. this means we have to wait for
the allocation result).

```yaml
kind: ResourceClaim
name: one-mid-or-large-gpu
spec:
  requests:
  - name: middle-or-large-gpu
    deviceClassName: gpu.example.com
    selectors:
    - cel:
        expression: 50g < device.attributes["memory"] and device.attributes["memory"] <= 100g
---
kind: Device
devices:
- className: gpu.example.com
  selectors:
  - cel:
      expression: device.attributes["memory"] <= 80g
```

### Defining DeviceClass mapping in ClusterQuota

The definition of what DeviceClasses construct a DRA device could be in ClusterQuota just before declaring the nominal
count for the device.

```golang
type DynamicResourceMapping struct {
	// Name is the resource name of this mapping. This will be referred in ClusterQueue
	// and Workload status
	Name corev1.ResourceName `json:"name"`

	// deviceClassNames lists the names of all the device classes that will count against
	// the quota defined in this resource
	// +listType=atomic
	DeviceClassNames []corev1.ResourceName `json:"deviceClassNames"`
}

type ResourceFlavorSpec struct {
	// dynamicResources defines Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation resources
	// +optional
	// +featureGate=DynamicResourceStructuredParameters
	// +listType=atomic
	// +kubebuilder:validation:MaxItems=16
	DynamicResources []DynamicResourceMapping `json:"dynamicResources,omitempty"`
}
```

This presents a problem where the same resource name could be used to define DeviceClasses A and B in one ClusterQueue
and DeviceClasses C, D and E in another ClusterQueue leading to conflicts. Since the mapping resource name to list of
DeviceClasses is not shared, it is hard to implement borrowing as it becomes very non-deterministic. Hence, this
approach
is not feasible.

### Using ResourceFlavor for DeviceClass Mapping

An earlier design considered embedding device class mappings directly in the ResourceFlavor API instead of creating
a separate DynamicResourceAllocationConfig CRD:

```golang
type DynamicResourceMapping struct {
	// Name is the resource name of this mapping. This will be referred in ClusterQueue
	// and Workload status
	Name corev1.ResourceName `json:"name"`

	// deviceClassNames lists the names of all the device classes that will count against
	// the quota defined in this resource
	// +listType=atomic
	DeviceClassNames []corev1.ResourceName `json:"deviceClassNames"`
}

type ResourceFlavorSpec struct {
	// dynamicResources defines Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation resources
	// +optional
	// +featureGate=DynamicResourceStructuredParameters
	// +listType=atomic
	// +kubebuilder:validation:MaxItems=16
	DynamicResources []DynamicResourceMapping `json:"dynamicResources,omitempty"`
}
```

However, this design had a major drawback. The biggest issue was semantic confusion - a dynamicResource like `gpu` in
ResourceFlavor1 could have deviceClass gpu-a.example.com while the same dynamicResource name in ResourceFlavor2 could
have the completely different deviceClass gpu-b.example.com. This creates significant confusion for cluster
administrators because the same resource name would have different meanings depending on which ResourceFlavor was being
referenced. The singleton DynamicResourceAllocationConfig CRD approach addresses this by providing a single source of
truth for all device class mappings in the cluster.

### Creating a new CRD for device class mapping

```golang
// +genclient
// +kubebuilder:object:root=true
// +kubebuilder:storageversion
// DynamicResourceAllocationConfig is a singleton CRD that maps resource names to device classes
// used in ClusterQueue resource quotas. It is singleton as "default" is the only allowed named for the CRD instance in
// Kueue namespace.
type DynamicResourceAllocationConfig struct {
    metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`
    metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
    // Spec defines the desired state of DynamicResourceAllocationConfig
    Spec DynamicResourceAllocationConfigSpec `json:"spec"`
}
// DynamicResourceAllocationConfigSpec defines the mappings between resource names and device classes
type DynamicResourceAllocationConfigSpec struct {
    // Resources is a list of mappings from resource name to device classes
    // +listType=map
    // +listMapKey=name
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxItems=16
    Resources []DynamicResource `json:"resources"`
}
// DynamicResource defines a mapping from a resource name to a list of device classes
type DynamicResource struct {
    // Name is the resource name that will be referred to in ClusterQueue and Workload admission status.
    Name corev1.ResourceName `json:"name"`
    // DeviceClassNames lists the names of all the device classes that will count against
    // the quota defined for this resource name
    // +listType=set
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxItems=8 
    DeviceClassNames []corev1.ResourceName `json:"deviceClassNames"`
}
```
However, this approach was introducing a significant amount of complexity in implementing the feature so it was rejected.

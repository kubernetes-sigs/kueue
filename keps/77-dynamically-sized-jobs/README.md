## Summary

Enable dynamic sizing of Kueue jobs. For the MVP, we will only focus on supporting RayClusters with autoscaling enabled, but other resources that can benefit from dynamic sizing should be supported eventually.

See: [Support dynamically sized (elastic) jobs #77](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/issues/77)

## Motivation

Kueue currently lacks support for resizing jobs. When a job is resized, Kueue will recreate the Workload representation of the job, leading to a disruptive suspend and requeue process. This limitation hinders the usability of Kueue for resources like RayCluster that sometimes have autoscaling capabilities enabled.

To properly support RayCluster, Kueue needs to gracefully handle the scale up and scale down of RayCluster nodes. Concretely this means that scaling the resources used by a RayCluster is appropriately reflected in the respective ClusterQueue without needing to suspend the entire RayCluster.

### Goals

- Gracefully handle resize operations for Kueue jobs (i.e. update quota usage without suspend, enqueue scale ups)
- Autoscaling RayCluster works with Kueue since it has an autoscaler and there is high demand (MVP)s

### Non-Goals

- Vertical scaling of workloads – Kueue will only handle resize operations that scale Pods horizontally 
- Support resize for other Kueue jobs such as Job, JobSet, etc (future)
- Resizing of RayJobs
- Partial Preemption

## Proposal

Update the Job framework reconciler and introduce new controllers to orchestrate dynamic resizing of jobs. We are only interested in horizontal scaling of jobs (e.g. scaling more replicas). At a high level, this will be accomplished by:
- Creating Workload Slice objects that represent incremental scale up of jobs. This gives us per-replica control of workload admission. Workload Slices will be garbage collected and consolidated with their parent workloads after successful admission.
- Adding default scheduling gates to control the scheduling of new pods based on their admission status.
- Dynamically adjust quotas in ClusterQueue based on scaling events.

For the MVP, we will only focus on admission of **RayClusters** with autoscaling enabled.

### User Stories

#### Story 1 - RayCluster w/ autoscaling

1. The user creates a RayCluster with `enableInTreeAutoscaling: true`.
2. Kueue admits the RayCluster based on the requested resources in the head pod and worker pod. 
3. Given the demand of the job, the Ray Autoscaler adjusts the replicas field as it adds or removes Pods from the cluster.
4. Kueue will not suspend and requeue the RayCluster, instead it will dynamically update ClusterQueue usage based on the scaling event. 

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

If Kueue needs to preempt the resized RayCluster, it would preempt it as a whole, regardless of whether the RayCluster was previously scaled up.

## Design Details

### Workload Slices
To support horizontal scaling of jobs, we will introduce the concept of a "Workload Slice”. A Workload Slice is a Workload object with an owner reference to the original Workload for a job. Workload Slices represent per-replica changes to a job that were not initially accounted for when the job was created. **It's an internal state, not an extra CRD.**

The benefit of Workload Slices is that Kueue can evaluate admission on a per-replica basis without changing the existing semantics of the Workload API. Once a Workload Slice is admitted, it will be garbage collected and its resources will be aggregated into the admission status of the parent workload.
- Workload Slices will be submitted to the same LocalQueue that's referenced by the top-level Workload. 
- In MultiKueue, Workload Slices would go into both clusters (management and workload) in a multi-cluster environment.
- Workload Slices will be created by Kueue and use identical PodTemplates (which is already enforced by Kuberay in the case for RayCluster).
- Workload Slices will belong to the same resource flavor as the top-level Workload that was initially admitted.

The parent Workload should have a condition that reflects the scaling progression status. 

```golang
const (
  ...
  ...
	// WorkloadResizeRequested means that the Workload is in the process of scaling up or down
	WorkloadResizeRequested = "ResizeRequested"
)

```

### Creating Workload Slices

The [GenericJob interface (7e778f5)](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/blob/main/pkg/controller/jobframework/interface.go#L30-L55) will be updated to handle resize operations of jobs.

```golang
type GenericJob interface {
  ...
  ...
  ResizeJob(wl *kueue.Workload) error
}
```
Jobs implementing the ResizeJob method will create a Workload Slice for every new replica of a job. 

On scale down to M we will change the original Workload's resources and then on scale up to N we will create N-M WorkloadSlice objects that go through admission and scheduling gate checks, i.e. the Workload can "lose" the original (first time admission) quota when scaling down before scaling up.

### Pod Scheduling Gates

Inside the job's webhook, implement schedulingGate injection for pods on creation time.
The Pods will be ungated following a similar behavior as to how a job is suspended and then unsuspended in the when admitted.
When the job scales up, the new pods will be gated due to the schedulingGates injection in the webhook.

After the creation of each individual Workload Slice and admission of a Workload Slice, the **workload_scheduling_gates_controller** should be in charge of removing the scheduling gates from each pod. All worker pods from the same worker group share the same pod template, so we only need to ungate the number of pods to match the number of admitted pods, this should be a counter. We don’t want to accidentally ungate too many pods since race conditions could happen and we also don’t want to double count. It's worth mentioning that for the case of recreated pods (i.e. machine failure for example), these pods will go through the admission/scheduling check again, Kueue is responsible fo removing the scheduling gates when there's available quota and resources to spend on the Job. 

### Garbage Collecting Workload Slices

The logic of folding and deleting would be isolated in this controller. We don’t necessarily have to say that this Workload Slice belongs to a specific pod. This controller will look at the Workload objects and check whether they have the Admitted condition or not.

1. The controller increments the `.status.admission.podSetAssignments.count` and passes the UID of the workload you are folding to the parent workload.
If we still don’t see the workload being deleted, we at least know it has been counted towards the parent workload and the controller shouldn't fold it again.

## Phases for MVP (alpha)

### Phase 1 - Scale Down
Scaling down will be the first phase towards MVP because it can be implemented without introducing the Workload Slices. 

Scaling down a Job won’t involve the creation of Workload Slices, instead it’ll involve an update to the current workload, no requeuing.

1. Compare Pod Counts: Within the job framework, check if the PodSet.Count of the job matches the Workload.Spec.PodSets[1].Count (worker group).
2. Synchronize Workload: If the pod counts don't match, update the workload to align with the job's PodSet.Count.
3. Trigger Resource Updates:  By updating the workload in cache and in queue, we'll signal the following:
- The cluster queue resource usage should recalculate, ensuring accurate resource management.
- The scheduler should re-evaluate and update PodSetAssignments related to the workload.


#### Job controller

Rework *equivalentToWorkload()* and *reconcile()* to account for potential differences between the job’s number of replicas and the running workload’s PodSet.Count. 

Given these changes, check if the delta is positive or negative indicating a scaleup/scaledown. If it’s a scaledown the reconciler should trigger an update on the workload to match the new job’s spec and no quota needs to be checked or accounted for, the cluster queue should update the workload resource usage. 

**Important:** in Phase 1 if there's a scale up, the behaviour will be suspend and requeue. This will be temporary while Phase 2 and 3 are not completed.

### Phase 2 - Aggregating Workload Slices

In Phase 2, aggregating Workload Slices into the parent workload will be implemented. This doesn't represent a usable feature to end users, but it can be reviewed independently from the phase 3.

### Phase 3 - Scale up with Workload Slices and Scheduling Gates

In Phase 3, scale up will be implemented by introducing Workload Slices and adding Pod scheduling gates as part of Kueue’s mutating admission for the job. 

When a job scales, its webhook would be modified to intercept and "gate" all pods. Every time there’s a resize, you create a dependable (child) workload slice and once it's admitted, you increase the count in the original workload, delete the old workload and remove the schedulingGates. 
- Pros: You are able to hold the pods added by Kuberay
- Cons: The fact of having schedulingGates, means we need an API call for every pod, because all pods that are created by the job are going to have schedulingGates. We need to remove those gates and for every pod you need to make API calls.

#### Scheduler
Since every scale up will have its own individual workload they should proceed to the current scheduling cycle and continue the normal admission process.
However, we need to ensure that the Workload Slice is assigned the same resource flavor as the parent workload. 

The `nominate()` returns the workloads with their requirements (resource flavors, borrowing) if they were admitted by the clusterQueues in the snapshot, so we need to return the original workload that was already admitted with the resize information inside *TotalRequests* so that *PodSetAssignments* is locked to the parent Workload assignments.

## Additional Details

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*
The goal is to ensure that we don't accept enhancements with inadequate testing.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

#### Unit Tests

<!--
In principle every added code should have complete unit test coverage, so providing
the exact set of tests will not bring additional value.
However, if complete unit test coverage is not possible, explain the reason of it
together with explanation why this is acceptable.
-->

<!--
Additionally, try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>

This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.
-->
The code will adhere to regular best practices for unit tests and coverage.



#### Integration tests
Integration tests will be executed against mocked clients for Jobs 
that will provide predefined responses and allow to test various scenarios, 
including situations like:

* Job has a scale up, workload slices get created, pods are gated
* Job has a scale up, gated pods are admitted, pods get ungated and assigned same flavors as parent workload
* Workload slices are correctly folded and deleted
* Job has a scale down, Workload spec reflects podset count values
* When Kueu preempt a resized Job, it should preempt it as a whole

### Graduation Criteria
<!--

Clearly define what it means for the feature to be implemented and
considered stable.

If the feature you are introducing has high complexity, consider adding graduation
milestones with these graduation criteria:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Feature gate][feature gate] lifecycle
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

[feature gate]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/
-->

The feature starts at the alpha level, with a feature gate.

In the Alpha version, Dynamically Sized Jobs will support RayCluster resizing. 
- Scale up/down of replica workers


## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->


## Alternatives


### Ignore Resize from Kuberay

- Idea: Ignoring the scale up or rejecting the scale up from the auto scaler and storing the value in an annotation so that Kueue takes a decision based on the annotation. We’d need a signal from Kueue to hold this in the raycluster_webhook and identify when the resize comes from Kueue, it has to be accepted.
- Pros: No need to intercept the pods and no need of using schedulingGates
- Cons: There would be a permanent race bewteen Kueue and Kuberay autoscaler to change the counter in the RayCluster replica number for the worker group. 
- Exploration: See if autoscaler would indicate a desired size in the spec without altering the number of replicas directly. 
- Discarded: Higher complexity than gating/ungating pods via SchedulingGates

## v0.3.0

Changes since `v0.2.1`:

### Features

- Support for kubeflow's MPIJob (v2beta1)
- Upgrade the `config.kueue.x-k8s.io` API version from `v1alpha1` to `v1beta1`. `v1alpha1` is no longer supported.
  `v1beta1` includes the following changes:
  - Add `namespace` to propagate the namespace where kueue is deployed to the webhook certificate.
  - Add `internalCertManagement` with fields `enable`, `webhookServiceName` and `webhookSecretName`.
  - Remove `enableInternalCertManagement`. Use `internalCertManagement.enable` instead.
- Upgrade the `kueue.x-k8s.io` API version from `v1alpha2` to `v1beta1`.
  `v1alpha2` is no longer supported.
  `v1beta1` includes the following changes:
  - `ClusterQueue`:
    - Immutability of `spec.queueingStrategy`.
    - Refactor `quota.min` and `quota.max` into `nominalQuota` and `borrowingLimit`.
    - Swap hierarchy between `resources` and `flavors`.
    - Group flavors and resources into `spec.resourceGroups` to make
      co-dependent resources explicit.
    - Move `admission` from `spec` to `status`.
    - Add `conditions` field to `status`.
  - `LocalQueue`:
    - Add `admitted` field in `status`.
    - Add `conditions` field to `status`.
  - `Workload`:
    - Add `metadata` to `podSet` templates.
    - Move `admission` into `status`.
  - `ResourceFlavor`:
    - Introduce `spec` to hold all fields.
    - Rename `labels` to `nodeLabels`.
    - Rename `taints` to `nodeTaints`.
- Reduce API calls by setting `.status.admission` and updating the `Admitted` condition in the same API call.
- Obtain queue names from label `kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name`. The annotation with
  the same name is still supported, but it's now deprecated.
- Multiplatform support for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.
- Validating webhook for `batch/v1.Job` validates kueue-specific labels and
  annotations.
- Sequential admission of jobs https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/setup_sequential_admission/
- Preemption within ClusterQueue and cohort https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/docs/concepts/cluster_queue/#preemption
- Support for LimitRanges when calculating jobs usage.
- Library for integrating job-like CRDs (controller and webhooks) https://sigs.k8s.io/kueue/pkg/controller/jobframework

## Production Readiness

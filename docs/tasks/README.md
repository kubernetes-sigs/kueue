# Tasks

The following tasks show you how to perform operations based on the Kueue user
personas such as _batch administrators_ and _batch users_.

## Batch administrator

A _batch administrator_ manages the cluster infrastructure and establishes
quotas and queues.

- As a batch administrator, you can learn how to [setup role-based access control](setup_rbac.md)
  to Kueue objects.
- As a batch administrator, you can learn how to
  [administer cluster quotas](administer_cluster_quotas.md) with ClusterQueues and LocalQueues.
- As a batch administrator, you can learn how to setup
  [Sequential Admission with Ready Pods](setup_sequential_admission.md).

## Batch user

A _batch user_ runs [workloads](/docs/concepts/workload.md). A typical
batch user is a researcher, AI/ML engineer, data scientist, among others.

- As a batch user, you can learn how to [run a Job on a cluster](run_jobs.md)
  managed with Kueue.

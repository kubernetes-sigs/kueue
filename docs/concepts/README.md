## Glossary

### Admission

The process of admitting a workload to start (pods to be created). A workload
is admitted by a ClusterQueue according to the available resources and gets
resource flavors assigned for each requested resource. Sometimes referred to
as _workload scheduling_ or _job scheduling_ (not to be confused with
[pod scheduling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/)).

### [Cohort](cluster_queue.md#cohort)

A group of ClusterQueues that can borrow unused quota from each other.

### Queueing

The time between a workload is created until it is admitted by a ClusterQueue.
Typically, the workload will compete with other workloads for available
quota based on the fair sharing rules of the ClusterQueue.

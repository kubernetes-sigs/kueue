# Kubectl Kjob Plugin

The `kubectl-kjob` plugin, `kjobctl`, allows you to list, describe and create jobs.

## Syntax

Use the following syntax to run `kubectl kjob` commands from your terminal window:

```shell
kubectl kjob [OPERATION] [TYPE] [NAME] [flags]
```

or with shorter syntax `kjobctl`:

```shell

```

You can go to the [commands](commands/_index.md) or run `kubectl kjob help` in the terminal to get the full list of commands, along with all possible flags.

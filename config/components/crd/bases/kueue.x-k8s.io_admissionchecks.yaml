                  RetryDelayMinutes specifies how long to keep the workload suspended after
                  a failed check (after it transitioned to False). When the delay period has passed, the check
                  state goes to "Unknown". The default is 15 min.
                  Deprecated: retryDelayMinutes has already been deprecated since v0.8 and will be removed in v1beta2.

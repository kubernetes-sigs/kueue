              cohort:
                description: "cohort that this ClusterQueue belongs to. CQs that belong
                  to the same cohort can borrow unused resources from each other.
                  \n A CQ can be a member of a single borrowing cohort. A workload
                  submitted to a queue referencing this CQ can borrow resources from
                  any CQ in the cohort. Only resources listed in the CQ can be borrowed
                  (see example). \n In the example below, the following applies: 1.
                  tenantB can run a workload consuming up to 20 k80 GPUs, meaning
                  a resource can be allocated from more than one clusterQueue in a
                  cohort. 2. tenantB can not consume any p100 GPUs or spot because
                  its CQ has no quota defined for them, and so the max is implicitly
                  0. 3. If both tenantA and tenantB are running jobs such that current
                  usage for tenantA is lower than its min quota (e.g., 5 k80 GPUs)
                  while tenantB’s usage is higher than its min quota (e.g., 12 k80
                  GPUs), and both tenants have pending jobs requesting the remaining
                  clusterQueue of the cohort (the 3 k80 GPUs), then tenantA jobs will
                  get this remaining clusterQueue since tenantA is below its min limit.
                  4. If a tenantA workload doesn't tolerate spot, then the workload
                  will only be eligible to consume on-demand cores (the next in the
                  list of cpu flavors). 5. Before considering on-demand, the workload
                  will get assigned spot if the quota can be borrowed from the cohort.

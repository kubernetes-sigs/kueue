              cohort:
                description: "cohort that this ClusterQueue belongs to. QCs that belong
                  to the same cohort can borrow unused resources from each other.
                  \n A QC can be a member of a single borrowing cohort. A workload
                  submitted to a queue referencing this QC can borrow resources from
                  any QC in the cohort. Only resources listed in the QC can be borrowed
                  (see example). \n In the example below, the following applies: 1.
                  tenantB can run a workload consuming up to 20 k80 GPUs, meaning
                  a resource can be allocated from more than one clusterQueue in a
                  cohort. 2. tenantB can not consume any p100 GPUs or spot because
                  its QC has no quota defined for them, and so the ceiling is practically
                  0. 3. If both tenantA and tenantB are running jobs such that current
                  usage for tenantA is lower than its guaranteed quota (e.g., 5 k80
                  GPUS) while tenantB’s usage is higher than its guaranteed quota
                  (e.g., 12 k80 GPUs), and both tenants have pending jobs requesting
                  the remaining clusterQueue of the cohort (the 3 k80 GPUs), then
                  tenantA jobs will get this remaining clusterQueue since tenantA
                  is below its guaranteed limit. 4. If a tenantA workload doesn’t
                  tolerate spot, then the workload will only be eligible to consume
                  on-demand cores (the next in the list of cpu flavors). \n <UNRESOLVED>
                  5. While evaluating a resource flavor’s list, what should take precedence:
                  honoring the preferred order in the list or keeping a usage under
                  the guaranteed clusterQueue? For example, if tenantA’s current k80
                  usage is 10 and tenantB’s usage is 5, should a future tenantA workload
                  that asks for any GPU model be assigned borrowed k80 clusterQueue
                  (since it is ordered first in the list) or p100 since its usage
                  is under tenantA’s guaranteed limit? The tradeoff is honoring tenantA’s
                  preferred order vs honoring fair sharing of future tenantB’s jobs
                  in a timely manner (or, when we have preemption, reduce the chance
                  of preempting tenantA’s workload) \n We could make that a user choice
                  via a knob on the QC or Cohort if we decide to have a dedicated
                  object API for it and start with preferring to consume guaranteed
                  clusterQueue first. </UNRESOLVED> \n metadata: name: tenantA spec:

                        of the same resource represent different hardware models (e.g.,
                        gpu models, cpu architectures) or pricing (on-demand vs spot
                        cpus). The flavors are distinguished via labels and taints.
                        \n For example, if the resource is nvidia.com/gpu, and we
                        want to define different limits for different gpu models,
                        then each model is mapped to a flavor and must set different
                        values of a shared key. For example: \n spec: requestableResources:
                        - name: nvidia.com/gpus - name: k80 quota: guaranteed: 10
                        labels: cloud.provider.com/accelerator: nvidia-tesla-k80 -
                        name: p100 quota: guaranteed: 10 labels: cloud.provider.com/accelerator:
                        nvidia-tesla-p100 \n The flavors are evaluated in order, selecting
                        the first to satisfy a workload’s requirements. Also the quantities
                        are additive, in the example above the GPU quota in total
                        is 20 (10 k80 + 10 p100). A workload is limited to the selected
                        type by converting the labels to a node selector that gets
                        injected into the workload. ​​This list can’t be empty, at
                        least one must exist. \n Note that a workload’s node affinity/selector
                        constraints are evaluated against the labels, and so batch
                        users can “filter” the flavors, but can’t force a different
                        order. For example, the following workload affinity will only
                        start the workload if P100 quota is available: \n matchExpressions:
                        - key: cloud.provider.com/accelerator value: nvidia-tesla-p100
                        \n Each type can also set taints so that it is opt-out by
                        default. A workload’s tolerations are evaluated against those
                        taints, and only the flavors that the workload tolerates are
                        considered. For example, an admin may choose to taint Spot
                        CPU clusterQueue, and if a workload doesn't tolerate it will
                        only be eligible to consume on-demand clusterQueue: \n - name:

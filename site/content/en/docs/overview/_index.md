  Why Kueue?
---

Kueue is a kubernetes-native system that manages quotas and how jobs consume them. Kueue decides when a job should wait, when a job should be admitted to start (as in pods can be created) and when a job should be preempted (as in active pods should be deleted).

## Why use Kueue

You can install Kueue on top of a vanilla Kubernetes cluster. Kueue does not replace any existing Kubernetes components. Kueue is compatible with cloud environments where:

* Compute resources are elastic and can be scaled up and down.
* Compute resources are heterogeneous (in architecture, availability, price, etc.).

Kueue APIs allow you to express:

* Quotas and policies for fair sharing among tenants.
* Resource fungibility: if a resource flavor is fully utilized, Kueue can admit the job using a different flavor.

A core design principle for Kueue is to avoid duplicating mature functionality in Kubernetes components and well-established third-party controllers. Autoscaling, pod-to-node scheduling and job lifecycle management are the responsibility of cluster-autoscaler, kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager, respectively. Advanced admission control can be delegated to controllers such as gatekeeper.

## Features overview

- **Job management:** Support job queueing based on [priorities](/docs/concepts/workload/#priority) with different [strategies](/docs/concepts/cluster_queue/#queueing-strategy): `StrictFIFO` and `BestEffortFIFO`.
- **Advanced Resource management:** Comprising: [resource flavor fungibility](/docs/concepts/cluster_queue/#flavorfungibility), [fair sharing](/docs/concepts/preemption/#fair-sharing), [cohorts](/docs/concepts/cluster_queue/#cohort) and [preemption](/docs/concepts/cluster_queue/#preemption) with a variety of policies between different tenants.
- **Integrations:** Built-in support for popular jobs, e.g. [BatchJob](/docs/tasks/run/jobs/), [Kubeflow training jobs](/docs/tasks/run/kubeflow/), [RayJob](/docs/tasks/run/rayjobs/), [RayCluster](/docs/tasks/run/rayclusters/), [JobSet](/docs/tasks/run/jobsets/),  [plain Pod and Pod Groups](/docs/tasks/run/plain_pods/).
- **System insight:** Build-in [prometheus metrics](/docs/reference/metrics/) to help monitor the state of the system, and on-demand visibility endpoint for [monitoring of pending workloads](/docs/tasks/manage/monitor_pending_workloads/pending_workloads_on_demand/).
- **AdmissionChecks:** A mechanism for internal or external components to influence whether a workload can be [admitted](/docs/concepts/admission_check/).
- **Advanced autoscaling support:** Integration with cluster-autoscaler's [provisioningRequest](/docs/admission-check-controllers/provisioning/#job-using-a-provisioningrequest) via admissionChecks.
- **All-or-nothing with ready Pods:** A timeout-based implementation of [All-or-nothing scheduling](/docs/tasks/manage/setup_wait_for_pods_ready/).
- **Partial admission and dynamic reclaim:** mechanisms to run a job with [reduced parallelism](/docs/tasks/run/jobs/#partial-admission), based on available quota, and to [release](/docs/concepts/workload/#dynamic-reclaim) the quota the pods complete..
- **Mixing training and inference**: Simultaneous management of batch workloads along with serving workloads (such as [Deployments](/docs/tasks/run/deployment/) or [StatefulSets](/docs/tasks/run/statefulset/))
- **Multi-cluster job dispatching:** called [MultiKueue](/docs/concepts/multikueue/), allows to search for capacity and off-load the main cluster.
- **Topology-Aware Scheduling**: Allows to optimize the pod-pod communication throughput by [scheduling aware of the data-center topology](/docs/concepts/topology_aware_scheduling/).

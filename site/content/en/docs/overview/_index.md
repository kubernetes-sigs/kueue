  Why Kueue?
---

Kueue is a kubernetes-native system that manages quotas and how jobs consume them. Kueue decides when a job should wait, when a job should be admitted to start (as in pods can be created) and when a job should be preempted (as in active pods should be deleted).

## Why use Kueue

You can install Kueue on top of a vanilla Kubernetes cluster. Kueue does not replace any existing Kubernetes components. Kueue is compatible with cloud environments where:

* Compute resources are elastic and can be scaled up and down.
* Compute resources are heterogeneous (in architecture, availability, price, etc.).

To learn more about Kueue concepts, see the [concepts](/docs/concepts) section.

To learn about different Kueue personas and what you can do with Kueue, see the [tasks](/docs/tasks) section.

Kueue APIs allow you to express:

* Quotas and policies for fair sharing among tenants.
* Resource fungibility: if a resource flavor is fully utilized, Kueue can admit the job using a different flavor.

A core design principle for Kueue is to avoid duplicating mature functionality in Kubernetes components and well-established third-party controllers. Autoscaling, pod-to-node scheduling and job lifecycle management are the responsibility of cluster-autoscaler, kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager, respectively. Advanced admission control can be delegated to controllers such as gatekeeper.

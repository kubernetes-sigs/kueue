  Running and debugging tests

## Running presubmission verification tests
```shell
make verify
```

## Running unit tests
To run all unit tests:
```shell
make test
```

To run unit tests for webhooks:
```shell
go test ./pkg/webhooks
```
To run tests that match `TestValidateClusterQueue` regular expression [ref](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Testing_flags):
```shell
go test ./pkg/webhooks -run TestValidateClusterQueue
```

### Running unit tests with race detection

Use `-race` to enable Go's built-in race detector:
```shell
go test ./pkg/scheduler/preemption/ -race
```

### Running unit tests with stress

To run unit tests in a loop and collect failures:
```shell
# install go stress
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stress@latest
# compile tests (you can add -race for race detection)
go test ./pkg/scheduler/preemption/ -c
# it loops and reports failures
stress ./preemption.test -test.run TestPreemption
```

## Running integration tests

```shell
make test-integration
```

For running a subset of tests, see [Running subset of tests](#running-subset-of-integration-or-e2e-tests).

### Increase logging verbosity
You can change log level in the framework (for example, change -3 to -5 to increase verbosity):
https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/blob/f8015cb273f9115c34f9be32b35f7e1308c16459/test/integration/framework/framework.go#L72:
```go
var setupLogger = sync.OnceFunc(func() {
	ctrl.SetLogger(util.NewTestingLogger(ginkgo.GinkgoWriter, -3))
})
```

## Running e2e tests using custom build
```shell
make kind-image-build
make test-e2e
make test-tas-e2e
make test-e2e-customconfigs
make test-multikueue-e2e
```

You can also change `kind` version by modifying `E2E_KIND_VERSION` variable:
```shell
E2E_KIND_VERSION=kindest/node:v1.32.0 make test-e2e
```

For running a subset of tests, see [Running subset of tests](#running-subset-of-integration-or-e2e-tests).

## Debug tests in VSCode
It is possible to debug unit and integration tests in VSCode.
You need to have the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go) installed.
Now you will have `run test | debug test` text buttons above lines like
```go
func TestValidateClusterQueue(t *testing.T) {
```
You can click on the `debug test` to debug a specific test.

For integration tests, an additional step is needed.  In settings.json, you need to add two variables inside `go.testEnvVars`:
- Run `ENVTEST_K8S_VERSION=1.32 make envtest && ./bin/setup-envtest use $ENVTEST_K8S_VERSION -p path` and assign the path to the `KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS` variable
- Set `KUEUE_BIN` to the `bin` directory within your cloned Kueue repository
```json
"go.testEnvVars": {
    "KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS": "<path from output above>",
    "KUEUE_BIN": "<path-to-your-kueue-folder>/bin",
  },
```

For e2e tests, you can also use [Ginkgo Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joselitofilho.ginkgotestexplorer).  You need to add the following variables to settings.json:
```json
 "ginkgotestexplorer.testEnvVars": {
        "KIND_CLUSTER_NAME": "kind",
        "WORKER1_KIND_CLUSTER_NAME": "kind-worker1",
        "MANAGER_KIND_CLUSTER_NAME": "kind-manager",
        "WORKER2_KIND_CLUSTER_NAME": "kind-worker2",
        "KIND": "<your_kueue_path>/bin/kind",
    },
```
and then you can use GUI of the Ginkgo Test Explorer to run individual tests, provided you started kind clanter (see [here](#attaching-e2e-tests-to-an-existing-kind-cluster) for the instructions).

## Attaching e2e tests to an existing kind cluster
You can use the following approach to start up a kind cluster and then run e2e tests from commandline or VSCode, attaching them to the existing cluster.  For example, suppose you want to test some of the multikueue-e2e tests. Comment the last line of the `hack/multikueue-e2e-test.sh` and add `read -p "run your tests now"` instead:
```shell
#$GINKGO $GINKGO_ARGS --junit-report=junit.xml --json-report=e2e.json --output-dir="$ARTIFACTS" -v ./test/e2e/multikueue/...
read -p "run your tests now"
```
Then, run `make kind-image-build test-multikueue-e2e` and wait for the `"run your tests now"` to appear.  The cluster is ready, and now you can run tests from another terminal:
```shell
<your_kueue_path>/bin/ginkgo --json-report ./ginkgo.report -focus "MultiKueue when Creating a multikueue admission check Should run a jobSet on worker if admitted" -r
```
or from VSCode.

## Running subset of integration or e2e tests
### Use Ginkgo --focus arg
```shell
GINKGO_ARGS="--focus=Scheduler" make test-integration
GINKGO_ARGS="--focus=Creating a Pod requesting TAS" make test-e2e
```
### Use ginkgo.FIt
If you want to focus on specific tests, you can change
`ginkgo.It` to `ginkgo.FIt` for these tests.
For more details, see [here](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#focused-specs).
Then the other tests will be skipped.
For example, you can change
```go
ginkgo.It("Should place pods based on the ranks-ordering", func() {
```
to
```go
ginkgo.FIt("Should place pods based on the ranks-ordering", func() {
```
and then run
```shell
# build and pull image
make test-tas-e2e
```
to test a particular TAS e2e test.

### Use INTEGRATION_TARGET
```shell
INTEGRATION_TARGET='test/integration/singlecluster/scheduler' make test-integration
```

## Flaky integration/e2e tests
You can use --until-it-fails or --repeat=N arguments to Ginkgo to run tests repeatedly, such as:
```shell
GINKGO_ARGS="--until-it-fails" make test-integration
GINKGO_ARGS="--repeat=10" make test-e2e
```
See more [here](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#repeating-spec-runs-and-managing-flaky-specs)

### Adding stress
You can run [stress](https://github.com/resurrecting-open-source-projects/stress) tool to increase CPU load during tests.  For example, if you're on Debian-based Linux:
```shell
# install stress:
sudo apt install stress
# run stress alongside tests
/usr/bin/stress --cpu 80
```

### Analyzing logs
Kueue runs as a regular pod on a worker node, and in e2e tests there are 2 replicas running.  The Kueue logs are located in `kind-worker/pods/kueue-system_kueue-controller-manager*/manager` and `kind-worker2/pods/kueue-system_kueue-controller-manager*/manager` folders.

For each log message you can from which file and line the message is coming from:
```log
2025-02-03T15:51:51.502425029Z stderr F 2025-02-03T15:51:51.502117824Z	LEVEL(-2)	cluster-queue-reconciler	core/clusterqueue_controller.go:341	ClusterQueue update event	{"clusterQueue": {"name":"cluster-queue"}}
```
Here, it's `core/clusterqueue_controller.go:341`.

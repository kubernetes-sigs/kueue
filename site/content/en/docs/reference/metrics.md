Kueue exposes [prometheus](https://prometheus.io) metrics to monitor the health
of the system and the status of [ClusterQueues](/docs/concepts/cluster_queue)
and [LocalQueues](/docs/concepts/local_queue).

<!-- NOTE: Sections below contain tables generated from code. Do not edit content between BEGIN/END GENERATED TABLE markers. Use `make generate-metrics-tables` to update. -->

## Kueue health

Use the following metrics to monitor the health of the kueue controllers:

  Doing common Kueue tasks
---

The following tasks show you how to perform operations based on the Kueue user
personas such as _batch administrators_ and _batch users_.

### Batch administrator

A _batch administrator_ manages the cluster infrastructure and establishes
quotas and queues.

- As a batch administrator, you can learn how to [setup role-based access control](/docs/tasks/rbac)
  to Kueue objects.
- As a batch administrator, you can learn how to
  [administer cluster quotas](/docs/tasks/administer_cluster_resources) with ClusterQueues and LocalQueues.
- As a batch administrator, you can learn how to setup
  [Sequential Admission with Ready Pods](/docs/tasks/setup_sequential_admission).

### Batch user

A _batch user_ runs [workloads](/docs/concepts/workload). A typical
batch user is a researcher, AI/ML engineer, data scientist, among others.

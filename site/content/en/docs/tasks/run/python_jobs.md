  Run Kueue jobs programmatically with Python
---

This guide is for [batch users](/docs/tasks#batch-user) that have a basic understanding of interacting with Kubernetes from Python. For more information, see [Kueue's overview](/docs/overview).

## Before you begin

Check [administer cluster quotas](/docs/tasks/manage/administer_cluster_quotas) for details on the initial cluster setup.
You'll also need kubernetes python installed. We recommend a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install kubernetes requests
```

Note that the following versions were used for developing these examples:

 - **Python**: 3.9.12
 - **kubernetes**: 26.1.0
 - **requests**: 2.31.0

You can either follow the [install instructions](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue#installation) for Kueue, or use the install example, below.

## Kueue in Python

Kueue at the core is a controller for a [Custom Resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/), and so to interact with it from Python we don't need a custom SDK, but rather we can use the generic functions provided by the
[Kubernetes Python](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python) library. In this guide, we provide several examples
for interacting with Kueue in this fashion. If you would like to request a new example or would like help for a specific use
case, please [open an issue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/issues).

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate different use cases for using Kueue in Python.

### Install Kueue

This example demonstrates installing Kueue to an existing cluster. You can save this
script to your local machine as `install-kueue-queues.py`. 

{{< include file="examples/python/install-kueue-queues.py" lang="python" >}}

And then run as follows:

```bash
python install-kueue-queues.py 
```

```console
‚≠êÔ∏è Installing Kueue...
‚≠êÔ∏è Applying queues from single-clusterqueue-setup.yaml...
```

You can also target a specific version:

```bash
python install-kueue-queues.py --version {{< param "version" >}}
```

### Sample Job

For the next example, let's start with a cluster with Kueue installed, and first create our queues:

{{< include file="examples/python/sample-job.py" code="true" lang="python" >}}

And run as follows:

```bash
python sample-job.py
```
```console
üì¶Ô∏è Container image selected is gcr.io/k8s-staging-perf-tests/sleep:v0.1.0...
‚≠êÔ∏è Creating sample job with prefix sample-job-...
Use:
"kubectl get queue" to see queue assignment
"kubectl get jobs" to see jobs
```

or try changing the name (`generateName`) of the job:

```bash
python sample-job.py --job-name sleep-job-
```

```console
üì¶Ô∏è Container image selected is gcr.io/k8s-staging-perf-tests/sleep:v0.1.0...
‚≠êÔ∏è Creating sample job with prefix sleep-job-...
Use:
"kubectl get queue" to see queue assignment
"kubectl get jobs" to see jobs
```

You can also change the container image with `--image` and args with `--args`.
For more customization, you can edit the example script.

### Interact with Queues and Jobs

If you are developing an application that submits jobs and needs to interact
with and check on them, you likely want to interact with queues or jobs directly.
After running the example above, you can test the following example to interact
with the results. Write the following to a script called `sample-queue-control.py`.

{{< include file="examples/python/sample-queue-control.py" lang="python" >}}

To make the output more interesting, we can run a few random jobs first:

```bash
python sample-job.py
python sample-job.py
python sample-job.py --job-name tacos
```

And then run the script to see your queue and sample job that you submit previously.

```bash
python sample-queue-control.py
```
```console
‚õëÔ∏è  Local Queues
Found queue user-queue
  Admitted workloads: 3
  Pending workloads: 0
  Flavor default-flavor has resources [{'name': 'cpu', 'total': '3'}, {'name': 'memory', 'total': '600Mi'}]

üíºÔ∏è Jobs
Found job sample-job-8n5sb
  Succeeded: 3
  Ready: 0
Found job sample-job-gnxtl
  Succeeded: 1
  Ready: 0
Found job tacos46bqw
  Succeeded: 1
  Ready: 1
```

If you wanted to filter jobs to a specific queue, you can do this via the job labels
under `job["metadata"]["labels"]["kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name"]'. To list a specific job by
name, you can do:

```python
from kubernetes import client, config

# Interact with batch
config.load_kube_config()
batch_api = client.BatchV1Api()

# This is providing the name, and namespace
job = batch_api.read_namespaced_job("tacos46bqw", "default")
print(job)
```

See the [BatchV1](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/blob/master/kubernetes/docs/BatchV1Api.md)
API documentation for more calls.


### Flux Operator Job

For this example, we will be using the [Flux Operator](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-operator)
to submit a job, and specifically using the [Python SDK](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-operator/tree/main/sdk/python/v1alpha1) to do this easily. Given our Python environment created in the [setup](#before-you-begin), we can install this Python SDK directly to it as follows:

```bash
pip install fluxoperator
```

We will also need to [install the Flux operator](https://flux-framework.org/flux-operator/getting_started/user-guide.html#quick-install). 

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flux-framework/flux-operator/main/examples/dist/flux-operator.yaml
```

Write the following script to `sample-flux-operator-job.py`:

{{< include file="examples/python/sample-flux-operator-job.py" lang="python" >}}

Now try running the example:

```bash
python sample-flux-operator-job.py
```
```console
üì¶Ô∏è Container image selected is ghcr.io/flux-framework/flux-restful-api...
‚≠êÔ∏è Creating sample job with prefix hello-world...
Use:
"kubectl get queue" to see queue assignment
"kubectl get pods" to see pods
```

You'll be able to almost immediately see the MiniCluster job admitted to the local queue:

```bash
kubectl get queue
```
```console
NAME         CLUSTERQUEUE    PENDING WORKLOADS   ADMITTED WORKLOADS
user-queue   cluster-queue   0                   1
```

And the 4 pods running (we are creating a networked cluster with 4 nodes):

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
```console
NAME                       READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
hello-world7qgqd-0-wp596   1/1     Running     0          7s
hello-world7qgqd-1-d7r87   1/1     Running     0          7s
hello-world7qgqd-2-rfn4t   1/1     Running     0          7s
hello-world7qgqd-3-blvtn   1/1     Running     0          7s
```

If you look at logs of the main broker pod (index 0 of the job above), there is a lot of
output for debugging, and you can see "hello world" running at the end:

```bash
kubectl logs hello-world7qgqd-0-wp596 
```

If you submit and ask for four tasks, you'll see "hello world" four times:

```bash

```
```console

You can further customize the job, and can ask questions on the [Flux Operator issues board](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-operator/issues).

### MPI Operator Job

For this example, we will be using the [MPI Operator](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/training/mpi/)
to submit a job, and specifically using the [Python SDK](https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator/tree/master/sdk/python/v2beta1) to do this easily. Given our Python environment created in the [setup](#before-you-begin), we can install this Python SDK directly to it as follows:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator /tmp/mpijob
cd /tmp/mpijob/sdk/python/v2beta1
python setup.py install
cd -
```

Importantly, the MPI Operator *must be installed before Kueue* for this to work! Let's start from scratch with a new Kind cluster.
We will also need to [install the MPI operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator/tree/master#installation) and Kueue. Here we install
the exact versions tested with this example:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator/releases/download/v0.4.0/mpi-operator.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/releases/download/v0.4.0/manifests.yaml
```

Check the [mpi-operator release page](https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator/releases) and [Kueue release page](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/releases) for alternate versions.
You need to wait until Kueue is ready. You can determine this as follows:

```bash
# Wait until you see all pods in the kueue-system are Running
kubectl get pods -n kueue-system
```

When Kueue is ready:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/main/site/static/examples/admin/single-clusterqueue-setup.yaml
```

Now try running the example MPIJob.

```bash
python sample-mpijob.py
```
```console
üì¶Ô∏è Container image selected is mpioperator/mpi-pi:openmpi...
‚≠êÔ∏è Creating sample job with prefix pi...
Use:
"kubectl get queue" to see queue assignment
"kubectl get jobs" to see jobs
```

{{< include "examples/python/sample-mpijob.py" "python" >}}

After submit, you can see that the queue has an admitted workload!

```bash
$ kubectl get queue
```
```console
NAME         CLUSTERQUEUE    PENDING WORKLOADS   ADMITTED WORKLOADS
user-queue   cluster-queue   0                   1
```

And that the job "pi-launcher" has started:

```bash
$ kubectl get jobs
NAME          COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
pi-launcher   0/1           9s         9s
```

The MPI Operator works by way of a central launcher interacting with nodes via ssh. We can inspect
a worker and the launcher to get a glimpse of how both work:

```bash
$ kubectl logs pods/pi-worker-1 
```
```console
Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22.
Server listening on :: port 22.
Accepted publickey for mpiuser from 10.244.0.8 port 51694 ssh2: ECDSA SHA256:rgZdwufXolOkUPA1w0bf780BNJC8e4/FivJb1/F7OOI

Disconnected from user mpiuser 10.244.0.8 port 51694
Received signal 15; terminating.
```

The job is fairly quick, and we can see the output of pi in the launcher:

```bash
$ kubectl logs pods/pi-launcher-f4gqv 
```
```console
Warning: Permanently added 'pi-worker-0.pi-worker.default.svc,10.244.0.7' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
Warning: Permanently added 'pi-worker-1.pi-worker.default.svc,10.244.0.9' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
Rank 1 on host pi-worker-1
Workers: 2
Rank 0 on host pi-worker-0
pi is approximately 3.1410376000000002
```

That looks like pi! üéâÔ∏èü•ßÔ∏è

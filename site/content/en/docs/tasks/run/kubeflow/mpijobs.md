  Run a Kueue scheduled MPIJob
---

This page shows how to leverage Kueue's scheduling and resource management capabilities when running [MPI Operator](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/training/mpi/) MPIJobs.

This guide is for [batch users](/docs/tasks#batch-user) that have a basic understanding of Kueue. For more information, see [Kueue's overview](/docs/overview).

## Before you begin

Check [administer cluster quotas](/docs/tasks/manage/administer_cluster_quotas) for details on the initial cluster setup.

Check [the MPI Operator installation guide](https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator#installation).

You can [modify kueue configurations from installed releases](/docs/installation#install-a-custom-configured-released-version) to include MPIJobs as an allowed workload.

In order to use MPIJob, prior to v0.8.1, you need to restart Kueue after the installation.
You can do it by running: `kubectl delete pods -lcontrol-plane=controller-manager -nkueue-system`.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
While using both MPI Operator and Training Operator, it is required to disable Training Operator's MPIJob option.
Training Operator deployment needs to be  modified to enable all kubeflow jobs except MPIJob, as mentioned [here](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/issues/1777).

## MPI Operator definition

### a. Queue selection

The target [local queue](/docs/concepts/local_queue) should be specified in the `metadata.labels` section of the MPIJob configuration.

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name: user-queue
```

### b. Optionally set Suspend field in MPIJobs

```yaml
spec:
  runPolicy:
    suspend: true
```

By default, Kueue will set `suspend` to true via webhook and unsuspend it when the MPIJob is admitted.

## Sample MPIJob

This example is based on https://github.com/kubeflow/mpi-operator/blob/ccf2756f749336d652fa6b10a732e241a40c7aa6/examples/v2beta1/pi/pi.yaml.

For equivalent instructions for doing this in Python, see [Run Python Jobs](/docs/tasks/run/python_jobs/#mpi-operator-job).

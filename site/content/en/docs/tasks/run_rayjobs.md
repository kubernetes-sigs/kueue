  Run a Kueue scheduled RayJob.

This page shows how to leverage Kueue's scheduling and resource management capabilities when running [KubeRay's](https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay/)
[RayJob](https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay/guidance/rayjob/).

This guide is for [batch users](/docs/tasks#batch-user) that have a basic understanding of Kueue. For more information, see [Kueue's overview](/docs/overview).

## Before you begin

1. Check [Administer cluster quotas](/docs/tasks/administer_cluster_quotas) for details on the initial Kueue setup.

2. See [KubeRay Installation](https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay/deploy/installation/) for installation and configuration details of KubeRay.

## RayJob definition

When running [RayJobs](https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay/guidance/rayjob/) on
Kueue, take into consideration the following aspects:

### a. Queue selection

The target [local queue](/docs/concepts/local_queue) should be specified in the `metadata.labels` section of the RayJob configuration.

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name: user-queue
```

### b. Configure the resource needs

The resource needs of the workload can be configured in the `spec.rayClusterSpec`.

```yaml
    headGroupSpec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - resources:
                requests:
                  cpu: "1"
    workerGroupSpecs:
      - template:
          spec:
            containers:
              - resources:
                  requests:
                    cpu: "1"
```

### c. Limitations

- A Kueue managed RayJob cannot use an existing RayCluster.
- The RayCluster should be deleted at the end of the job execution, `spec.ShutdownAfterJobFinishes` should be `true`.
- Because Kueue will reserve resources for the RayCluster, `spec.rayClusterSpec.enableInTreeAutoscaling` should be `false`.
- Because a Kueue workload can have a maximum of 8 PodSets, the maximum number of `spec.rayClusterSpec.workerGroupSpecs` is 7.

## Example RayJob

In this example, the code is provided to the Ray framework via a ConfigMap.

{{< include "examples/jobs/ray-job-code-sample.yaml" "yaml" >}}

The RayJob looks like the following:

{{< include "examples/jobs/ray-job-sample.yaml" "yaml" >}}

You can run this RayJob with the following commands:

```sh
# Create the code ConfigMap (once)
kubectl apply -f ray-job-code-sample.yaml
# Create a RayJob. You can run this command multiple times
# to observe the queueing and admission of the jobs.
kubectl create -f ray-job-sample.yaml
```

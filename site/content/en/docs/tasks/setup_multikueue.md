Check the concepts section for a [MultiKueue overview](/docs/concepts/multikueue/). 

#### Worker Cluster

When MultiKueue dispatches a workload from the manager cluster to a worker cluster, it expects that the job's namespace and LocalQueue also exist in the worker cluster.
In other words, you should ensure that the worker cluster configuration mirrors the one of the manager cluster in terms of namespaces and LocalQueues.

#### Manager Cluster

{{< include "/examples/multikueue/multikueue-setup.yaml" "yaml" >}}

For the example provided, having the worker1 cluster kubeconfig stored in a file called `worker1.kubeconfig`, you can create the `worker1-secret` secret by running the following command:

```bash
 kubectl create secret generic worker1-secret -n kueue-system --from-file=kubeconfig=worker1.kubeconfig
```

It is common that AI/ML workloads require a significant amount of pod-to-pod
communication. Therefore the network bandwidth between the running Pods
translates into the workload execution time, and the cost of running
such workloads. The available bandwidth between the Pods depends on the placement
of the Nodes, running the Pods, in the data center.

We observe that the data centers have a hierarchical structure of their
organizational units, like racks and blocks, where there are multiple nodes
within a rack, and there are multiple racks within a block. Pods running within
the same organizational unit have better network bandwidth than Pods on
different units. We say that nodes placed in different racks are more distant
than nodes placed within the same rack. Similarly, nodes placed in different
blocks are more distant than two nodes within the same block.

In this feature (called Topology Aware Scheduling, or TAS for short) we
introduce a convention to represent the
[hierarchical node topology information](#node-topology-information), and a set
of APIs for Kueue administrators and users to utilize the information
to optimize the Pod placement.

### Node topology information

We propose a lightweight model for representing the hierarchy of nodes within a
data center by using node labels. In this model the node labels are set up by a
cloud provider, or set up manually by administrators of on-premise clusters.

Additionally, we assume that every node used for TAS has a set of the labels
which identifies uniquely its location in the tree structure. We do not assume
global uniqueness of labels on each level, i.e. there could be two nodes with
the same "rack" label, but in different "blocks".

For example, this is a representation of the data center hierarchy;

|  node  |  cloud.provider.com/topology-block | cloud.provider.com/topology-rack |
|:------:|:----------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
| node-1 |               block-1              |              rack-1              |
| node-2 |               block-1              |              rack-2              |
| node-3 |               block-2              |              rack-1              |
| node-4 |               block-2              |              rack-3              |

Note that, there is a pair of nodes, node-1 and node-3, with the same value of
the "cloud.provider.com/topology-rack" label, but in different blocks.

### Capacity calculation

For each PodSet TAS determines the current free capacity per each topology
domain (like a given rack) by:
- including Node allocatable capacity (based on the `.status.allocatable` field)
  of only ready (with `Ready=True` condition) and schedulable (with `.spec.unschedulable=false`) Nodes,
- subtracting the usage coming from all other admitted TAS workloads,
- subtracting the usage coming from all other non-TAS Pods (owned mainly by
  DaemonSets, but also including static Pods, Deployments, etc.).

### Admin-facing APIs

As an admin, in order to enable the feature you need to:
1. ensure the `TopologyAwareScheduling` feature gate is enabled
2. create at least one instance of the `Topology` API
3. reference the `Topology` API from a dedicated ResourceFlavor by the
   `.spec.topologyName` field

#### Example

{{< include "examples/tas/sample-queues.yaml" "yaml" >}}

### User-facing APIs

Once TAS is configured and ready to be used, you can create Jobs with the
following annotations set at the PodTemplate level:
- `kueue.x-k8s.io/podset-preferred-topology` - indicates that a PodSet requires
	Topology Aware Scheduling, but scheduling all pods within pods on nodes
	within the same topology domain is a preference rather than requirement.
	The levels are evaluated one-by-one going up from the level indicated by
	the annotation. If the PodSet cannot fit within a given topology domain
	then the next topology level up is considered. If the PodSet cannot fit
	at the highest topology level, then it gets admitted as distributed
	among multiple topology domains.
- `kueue.x-k8s.io/podset-required-topology` - indicates indicates that a PodSet
  requires Topology Aware Scheduling, and requires scheduling all pods on nodes
	within the same topology domain corresponding to the topology level
	indicated by the annotation value (e.g. within a rack or within a block).

#### Example

Here is an example Job a user might submit to use TAS. It assumes there exists
a LocalQueue named `tas-user-queue` which refernces the ClusterQueue pointing
to a TAS ResourceFlavor.

{{< include "examples/tas/sample-job-preferred.yaml" "yaml" >}}

### ClusterAutoscaler support

TAS integrates with the [Kubernetes ClusterAutoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler)
through the [Provisioning AdmissionCheck](/docs/admission-check-controllers/provisioning/).

When a workload is assigned to the TAS ResourceFlavor with Provisioning
AdmissionCheck, then its admission flow has the following stages:
1. **Quota reservation**: quota is reserved, and the Workload obtains the
  `QuotaReserved` condition. Preemptions are evaluated if configured.
2. **Admission checks**: Kueue waits for all AdmissionChecks, including the
  Provisioning one, to report `Ready` inside the Workload's
  `status.admissionChecks` field.
3. **Topology assignment**: Kueue sets topology assignment, on the Workload
  object, calculated taking into account any newly provisioned nodes.

Check also [PodSet updates in ProvisioningRequestConfig](site/content/en/docs/admission-check-controllers/provisioning.md)
to see how you can configure Kueue if you want to restrict scheduling to the
newly provisioned nodes (assuming the provisioning class supports it).

### Hot swap support
{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
To enable the feature, you have to set the [feature gate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/)
`TASFailedNodeReplacement` to `true` and the lowest topological label has to be
`kubernetes.io/hostname`. This feature was introduced to Kueue in version 0.12.
{{% /alert %}}

When the lowest level of Topology is set to node, TAS finds a fixed assignment
of pods to nodes and injects a NodeSelector to make sure the pods get scheduled
on the selected nodes. But this means that in case
of any node failures or deletions, which occur during the runtime of a workload,
the workload cannot run on any other nodes. In order to avoid costly re-scheduling
of the entire TAS workload we introduce the node hot swap feature.

With this feature, TAS tries to find a replacement of the failed or deleted node for
all the affected workloads, without changing the rest of the topology assignment.
Currently this works only for a single node failure at the time and in case of multiple failures,
the workload gets evicted. The node is assumed to have failed if its `conditions.Status.Ready`
is not `True` for at least 30 seconds or if the node is missing (removed from the cluster).

Note that finding a replacement node within the old domain (like rack) may not always
be possible. Hence, we recommend using [WaitForPodsReady](/docs/tasks/manage/setup_wait_for_pods_ready/)
and configuring `waitForPodsReady.recoveryTimeout`, to prevent the workloads from
waiting for the replacement indefinetly.

### Limitations

Currently, there are limitations for the compatibility of TAS with other
features, including:
- some scheduling directives (e.g. pod affinities and anti-affinities) are ignored,
- the "podset-required-topology" annotation may fail if the underlying
  ClusterAutoscaler cannot provision nodes that satisfy the domain constraint,
- a ClusterQueue for [MultiKueue](multikueue.md) referencing a ResourceFlavor
with Topology name (`.spec.topologyName`) is marked as inactive.

These usage scenarios are considered to be supported in the future releases
of Kueue.

## Drawbacks

When enabling the feature Kueue starts to keep track of all Pods and all nodes
in the system, which results in larger memory requirements for Kueue.
Additionally, Kueue will take longer to schedule the workloads as it needs to
take the topology information into account.
